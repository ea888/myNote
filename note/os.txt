ln -s file1 link1
A hard link then just creates another file with a link to the same underlying inode. Once a hard link has been made the link is to the inode. deleting renaming or moving the original file will not affect the hard link as it links to the underlying inode. Any changes to the data on the inode is reflected in all files that refer to that inode.
A symbolic link is a link to another name in the file system.
